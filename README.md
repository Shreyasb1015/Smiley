# SMILEY


The Smiley program is a simple program written in c language, that generates smiley face by manipulating the pixels of an image. 


## Appendix

The program is coded to work with BMP files and it aims to change all the black pixels of image to the color of your choosing.

The smiley face we will be working with is not just made of 1's and 0's,or black and white pixels,but consists of 24 bits per pixel.It uses 8 bits to represent red,green and blue values each.
Hence by mixing the values of red,green and blue,we can create smiley face of millions of possible colours.
